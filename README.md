# Hello, I'm Sven Katava!

I'm a passionate C++ developer with experience in building projects using OpenGL, ImGui, ImPlot, and glad. I love experimenting with different technologies, and I'm continuously expanding my skill set with SQL and Git, while switching between Linux and Windows for my development work.

## About Me
I’m currently focused on mastering C++ and creating engaging desktop applications. My journey began with the **GravitySim** project, which uses modern C++ and graphics libraries to simulate gravitational interactions. I’m eager to evolve my work by integrating other technologies such as SQL and exploring design aspects in my upcoming projects.
